Hi, my name is Abylaikhan Mukhamejanov. I’m a Mechanical Engineering student at Lehigh University with experience in mechanical design, manufacturing, and robotics. I am also from the beautiful country of Kazakhstan 🇰🇿.

For the past two years, I’ve been conducting research on bio-inspired underwater propulsion systems 🌊 under Dr. Moored, where I design and build experimental robotic setups and develop control systems for fluid–structure interaction studies. I serve as the Structures Lead for Lehigh’s first NASA CubeSat Launch Initiative project 🚀, leading the mechanical design of our nanosatellite and contributing to over $200K in raised funding. I’m also part of the Formula SAE team 🏎️, working on suspension and composite structures.

These experiences strengthened my skills in:

SolidWorks & ANSYS Workbench (FEA)

Manufacturing: 3D printing, CNC machining, waterjet cutting, injection molding

Mechanical systems integration (actuators, sensors, electronics)

MATLAB & control systems

Outside of engineering, I love traveling and working outdoors. I recently built a gazebo at my family’s country house — a project that reminded me why I love hands-on engineering. I also enjoy skiing ⛷️ and horse riding 🐎.
