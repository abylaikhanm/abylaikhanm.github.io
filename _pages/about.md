Hi, my name is Abylaikhan! I am a Software Engineer with experience in ML and cloud technologies. I am also from a beautiful country of Kazakhstan 🇰🇿.

Along with my passion for Machine/Deep Learning technologies and Software Engineering, I am deeply interested in topics related to Neuroscience, Cognitive Science, and Philosophy. I believe that the link between the brain and AI is what will shape the future of humanity.

In addition to my academic pursuits, I am an avid martial artist with 15+ years of experience in karate (I am 2nd-degree black belt🥋). Martial arts have taught me discipline, courage, persistence, and humility, which are important in my life. I enjoy reading books, playing guitar, and sharing my thoughts in my [blog on Telegram](https://t.me/abekek_notes).
