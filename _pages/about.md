I am a Mechanical Engineering student and Undergraduate Researcher at Lehigh University, working in the Unsteady Flow Interactions Laboratory under Prof. Keith Moored and PhD mentor Ata Ardıç.

My research focuses on uncovering the fluid–structure interactions underlying bio-inspired propulsion using cyber-physical fluid dynamics. I design and build experimental robotic propulsion systems integrating precision mechanical hardware, embedded sensing, and real-time control to investigate propulsion physics and enable next-generation autonomous underwater vehicles.

In parallel, I serve as Lead Mechanical Engineer for OSPREY, Lehigh University's first NASA CubeSat Launch Initiative nanosatellite, where I lead structural design, mechanical integration, and system validation for spaceflight hardware.

My broader research interests include:

- Bio-inspired robotics and propulsion  
- Fluid–structure interactions  
- Cyber-physical experimental systems  
- Mechatronics and control systems  
- Autonomous underwater and space systems  

I am originally from Kazakhstan 🇰🇿, where I developed my passion for engineering through hands-on building, fabrication, and experimentation from a young age.
