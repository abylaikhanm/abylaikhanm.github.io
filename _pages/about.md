Hi, my name is **Abylaikhan Mukhamejanov**. I am a Mechanical Engineering student and Undergraduate Researcher at Lehigh University, working in the Unsteady Flow Interactions Laboratory under Prof. Keith Moored and PhD mentor Ata Ardıç.

My research focuses on uncovering the fluid–structure interactions underlying bio-inspired propulsion using cyber-physical fluid dynamics. I design and build robotic experimental systems integrating precision mechanical hardware, embedded sensors, and real-time control to investigate propulsion physics and enable next-generation autonomous underwater vehicles.

My broader research interests include:

- Bio-inspired robotics and propulsion  
- Fluid–structure interactions  
- Cyber-physical experimental systems  
- Mechatronics and control  
- Autonomous underwater and space systems  

I am originally from Kazakhstan 🇰🇿, where I developed my passion for engineering through hands-on building and fabrication from a young age.
