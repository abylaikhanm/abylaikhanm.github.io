# Research Experience

## Undergraduate Researcher - Unsteady Flow Interactions Laboratory
**Lehigh University, Bethlehem, PA**  
*Nov 2023 – Present*

# Bio-Inspired Riverine Power Generation
- Designed a bio-inspired setup to mimic pitch and heave movements in flexible hydrofoils for the investigation of hydrodynamic performance and quiet underwater vehicle development, part of a $7.5M U.S. Department of Defense-funded project.
- Integrated and calibrated a particle image velocimetry system, high-torque step motors, and a 6-axis force sensor.
- Designed, built, and tested experimental setups using **SolidWorks**, **CNC milling**, **waterjet cutting**, and **3D printing**.
- Conducted 35 water channel experiments utilizing **NI DAQ** and **MATLAB** to evaluate hydrodynamic performance and stability.
- Improved movement accuracy by 98.2%, a 1.75x improvement over the previous design, and reduced noise by 32% through closed-loop velocity control.

# Bio-Inspired Riverine Power Generation
- Contributed to a project developing a hydrokinetic turbine, using bio-inspired hydrofoils to convert motion into electricity, funded by the U.S. DOD and DOE.
- Boosted power generation output by 57% by implementing a wireless communication system for real-time data analysis and control.

## Research Intern - Aerospace Systems Control Lab
**Lehigh University, Bethlehem, PA**  
*May 2024 – Aug 2024*

- Led wind tunnel testing on AeroTargets' 33% scale **LOCOST UAV**, focusing on lift, drag, and stability performance.
- Acquired and analyzed over 100 experimental data sets using **LabVIEW**, **MATLAB**, and **NI DAQ**.
- Measured aerodynamic forces with a 6-axis force sensor and validated results at Reynolds numbers 20% higher than expected.
- Communicated design recommendations to AeroTargets engineers, leading to a 10% reduction in the UAV's drag coefficient.
