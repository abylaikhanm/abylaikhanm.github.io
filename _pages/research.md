## Undergraduate Researcher - Unsteady Flow Interactions Laboratory
**Lehigh University, Bethlehem, PA**  
*Nov 2023 – Present*

### Pitch and Heave Setup
I worked on a research project as part of the Multi-disciplinary University Research Initiatives award (MURI - $7.5M U.S. Department of Defense-funded project), collaborating with Princeton University, Harvard University, and the University of Virginia. The project focused on investigating the hydrodynamics of bio-robotic schooling systems for high-speed and high-efficiency swimming. My responsibilities included designing the experimental apparatus and developing the data acquisition architecture. I was also involved in integrating and calibrating a particle image velocimetry system, high-torque step motors, and a 6-axis force sensor. This work resulted in improved movement accuracy by 98.2% and a 32% reduction in noise, demonstrating a significant enhancement over previous designs through the implementation of closed-loop velocity control. Please take a look at my poster below for more technical details of this research project.

### Bio-Inspired Riverine Power Generation
I contributed to a research project under the supervision of Prof. Keith Moored, funded by the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) and the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE). The project focused on developing a hydrokinetic turbine utilizing bio-inspired hydrofoils to convert water flow into electricity, aiming to provide renewable energy solutions suitable for both remote villages and large cities. My responsibilities included designing and implementing a wireless communication system for closed-loop control and real-time data acquisition, which enhanced power generation output by 57%. This advancement underscores the potential of bio-inspired technologies in achieving efficient and sustainable energy production.

## Research Intern - Aerospace Systems Control Laboratory
**Lehigh University, Bethlehem, PA**  
*May 2024 – Aug 2024*

I worked on the Wind Tunnel Test Program (WTTP) for the LOCOST UAV as part of a project with AeroTargets International at Lehigh University's wind tunnel facility, under the supervision of Prof. Keith Moored. This project focused on gathering aerodynamic data for a 33% scale model of the LOCOST uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) to improve its lift and drag characteristics. My responsibilities included designing the experimental setup, data acquisition using a six-axis force/torque sensor, and operating the wind tunnel under varying conditions. I measured key aerodynamic parameters, including lift and drag coefficients, over a range of Reynolds numbers. The data collected was essential in optimizing the UAV's design for better flight stability and aerodynamic performance, ultimately reducing the vehicle’s drag by 10%.
