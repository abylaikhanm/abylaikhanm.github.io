## Undergraduate Researcher - Unsteady Flow Interactions Laboratory
**Lehigh University, Bethlehem, PA**  
*Nov 2023 – Present*

### Pitch and Heave Setup
I worked on a research project as part of the Multi-disciplinary University Research Initiatives award (MURI - $7.5M U.S. Department of Defense-funded project), collaborating with Princeton University, Harvard University, and the University of Virginia. The project focused on investigating the hydrodynamics of bio-robotic schooling systems for high-speed and high-efficiency swimming. designing the experimental apparatus and developing the data acquisition architecture. y contributions included designing the experimental apparatus, integrating and calibrating a particle image velocimetry system, high-torque step motors, and a 6-axis force sensor. This work resulted in improved movement accuracy by 98.2% and a 32% reduction in noise, demonstrating a significant enhancement over previous designs through the implementation of closed-loop velocity control. Please take a look at my poster below for more technical details of this research project.

### Bio-Inspired Riverine Power Generation
I contributed to a research project under the supervision of Prof. Keith Moored, funded by the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) and the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE). The project focused on developing a hydrokinetic turbine utilizing bio-inspired hydrofoils to convert water flow into electricity, aiming to provide renewable energy solutions suitable for both remote villages and large cities. My responsibilities included designing and implementing a wireless communication system for closed-loop control and real-time data acquisition, which enhanced power generation output by 57%. This advancement underscores the potential of bio-inspired technologies in achieving efficient and sustainable energy production.

## Research Intern - Aerospace Systems Control Laboratory
**Lehigh University, Bethlehem, PA**  
*May 2024 – Aug 2024*

- Led wind tunnel testing on AeroTargets' 33% scale **LOCOST UAV**, focusing on lift, drag, and stability performance.
- Acquired and analyzed over 100 experimental data sets using **LabVIEW**, **MATLAB**, and **NI DAQ**.
- Measured aerodynamic forces with a 6-axis force sensor and validated results at Reynolds numbers 20% higher than expected.
- Communicated design recommendations to AeroTargets engineers, leading to a 10% reduction in the UAV's drag coefficient.
