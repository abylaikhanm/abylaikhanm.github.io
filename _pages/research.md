## Undergraduate Researcher - Unsteady Flow Interactions Laboratory
**Lehigh University, Bethlehem, PA**  
*Nov 2023 – Present*

### [Pitch and Heave Setup for Bio-Propulsion Studies](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jffg0PIKivp45YWeB3Ubjm66hILFO0br/view)
I am currently working on a research project as part of the Multi-disciplinary University Research Initiatives award (**MURI - $7.5M U.S. Department of Defense-funded project**), collaborating with Princeton University, Harvard University, and the University of Virginia. The project focuses on **investigating the hydrodynamics of bio-robotic schooling systems** for high-speed and high-efficiency swimming. My responsibilities are designing the experimental setup, developing data acquisition architecture, and integrating a particle image velocimetry system, high-torque motors, and a 6-axis force sensor.

### [Bio-Inspired Riverine Power Generation](https://engineering.lehigh.edu/meche/research/featured-projects/bio-inspired-riverine-power-generation)
I contribute to a research project under the supervision of Prof. Keith Moored, **funded by the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) and the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)**. The project focuses on developing a **hydrokinetic turbine utilizing bio-inspired hydrofoils to convert water flow into electricity**, aiming to provide renewable energy solutions suitable for remote villages and large cities. My responsibilities are designing and implementing a wireless communication system for closed-loop control and real-time data acquisition, which enhanced power generation output by 57%.

## Research Intern - Aerospace Systems Control Laboratory
**Lehigh University, Bethlehem, PA**  
*May 2024 – Aug 2024*

### [LOCOST UAV Wind Tunnel Test Program](http://www.aerotargets.com/)

I worked on the **Wind Tunnel Test Program (WTTP) for the LOCOST UAV with AeroTargets International**, under Prof. Keith Moored. The project aimed to **improve lift and drag characteristics** for a 33% scale UAV model. I designed the experimental setup, conducted data acquisition using a six-axis force/torque sensor, and operated the wind tunnel. The aerodynamic data collected helped optimize the UAV's design, **reducing its drag by 10%.**

## Undergraduate Researcher - Nano Human Interfaces Presidential Initiative
**Lehigh University, Bethlehem, PA**  
*Sep 2023 – May 2024*

### [Nanoscale Topography of Perovskite Solar Cells](https://nhi.lehigh.edu/projects/perovskite-solar-cell-surface)

I worked on a VR/AR/XR project focused on visualizing the nanoscale topography of perovskite solar cells, using data from Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM). This project is part of emerging renewable energy research, where understanding surface characteristics is critical for improving device performance. My CAD skills were key to interpreting AFM data, aiding in the design of more efficient preparation procedures. I worked on **AR model for users to explore the cell’s surface topography in 3D**, enhancing comprehension of its structure and performance.
