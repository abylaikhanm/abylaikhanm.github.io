## Undergraduate Researcher - Unsteady Flow Interactions Laboratory
**Lehigh University, Bethlehem, PA**  
*Nov 2023 – Present*

### [Pitch and Heave Setup](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jffg0PIKivp45YWeB3Ubjm66hILFO0br/view)
I worked on a research project as part of the Multi-disciplinary University Research Initiatives award (MURI - $7.5M U.S. Department of Defense-funded project), collaborating with Princeton University, Harvard University, and the University of Virginia. The project focused on investigating the hydrodynamics of bio-robotic schooling systems for high-speed and high-efficiency swimming. My role included designing the experimental setup, developing data acquisition architecture, and integrating a particle image velocimetry system, high-torque motors, and a 6-axis force sensor. This improved movement accuracy by 98.2% and reduced noise by 32%, significantly enhancing previous designs through closed-loop velocity control.

### [Bio-Inspired Riverine Power Generation](https://engineering.lehigh.edu/meche/research/featured-projects/bio-inspired-riverine-power-generation)
I contributed to a research project under the supervision of Prof. Keith Moored, funded by the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) and the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE). The project focused on developing a hydrokinetic turbine utilizing bio-inspired hydrofoils to convert water flow into electricity, aiming to provide renewable energy solutions suitable for both remote villages and large cities. My responsibilities included designing and implementing a wireless communication system for closed-loop control and real-time data acquisition, which enhanced power generation output by 57%.

## Research Intern - Aerospace Systems Control Laboratory
**Lehigh University, Bethlehem, PA**  
*May 2024 – Aug 2024*

I worked on the Wind Tunnel Test Program (WTTP) for the LOCOST UAV with AeroTargets International at Lehigh University, under Prof. Keith Moored. The project aimed to improve lift and drag characteristics for a 33% scale UAV model. I designed the experimental setup, conducted data acquisition using a six-axis force/torque sensor, and operated the wind tunnel. The aerodynamic data collected helped optimize the UAV's design, reducing its drag by 10%.
