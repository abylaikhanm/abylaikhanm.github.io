I teach over 200 students per semester Python programming and hardware integration, guiding them through hands-on projects with Raspberry Pi and Arduino. Each week, I lead lab sessions designed to enhance students' problem-solving skills with Python and help them apply theoretical concepts to controlling self-driving cars using various modules and sensors.
