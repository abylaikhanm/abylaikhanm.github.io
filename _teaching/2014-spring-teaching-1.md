I teach over 200 students per semester Python programming and hardware integration, guiding them through hands-on projects with Raspberry Pi and Arduino. Each week, I lead lab sessions aimed at enhancing their problem-solving skills with Python and applying theoretical concepts to controlling self-driving cars with a set of modules and sensors.
